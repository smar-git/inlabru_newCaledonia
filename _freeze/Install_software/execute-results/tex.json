The package will in many cases also work with older R versions, but compatibility is sometimes difficult.\n\n## Installing `INLA` and `inlabru`\n\nDue to the work involved in building the binaries for the INLA package C software for different architectures, the INLA package is not on CRAN, but it can be installed from its own distribution\nrepository. \n\n1.  Check your `R` version.\n\n2.  Install R-INLA, instructions can be found  [here](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install)\n\n3.  Install `inlabru` (available from CRAN)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Enable universe(s) by inlabru-org\noptions(repos = c(\n  inlabruorg = \"https://inlabru-org.r-universe.dev\",\n  INLA = \"https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/testing\",\n  CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"\n))\n\n# Install some packages\ninstall.packages(\"inlabru\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n3.  Make sure you have the latest `R-INLA`, `inlabru` and `R` versions installed.\n\n4.  Install the following libraries:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\ninstall.packages(c(\n  \"dplyr\",\n  \"ggplot2\"\n))\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Installation check\n\nPlease check your installation using the basic model runs below. \n\nIf you run into issues, you can post a question with information about what you tried and what didn't work, on the [course github discussion page](https://github.com/smar-git/inlabru_newCaledonia/discussions).\n\nYou can check that `INLA` is correctly installed by running\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- data.frame(y = rnorm(100) + 10)\nfit <- INLA::inla(\n  y ~ 1,\n  data = df\n)\nsummary(fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nTime used:\n    Pre = 0.963, Running = 0.19, Post = 0.00811, Total = 1.16 \nFixed effects:\n             mean    sd 0.025quant 0.5quant 0.975quant  mode kld\n(Intercept) 9.974 0.103      9.771    9.974     10.177 9.974   0\n\nModel hyperparameters:\n                                         mean    sd 0.025quant 0.5quant\nPrecision for the Gaussian observations 0.952 0.134      0.708    0.946\n                                        0.975quant  mode\nPrecision for the Gaussian observations       1.23 0.933\n\nMarginal log-Likelihood:  -157.21 \n is computed \nPosterior summaries for the linear predictor and the fitted values are computed\n(Posterior marginals needs also 'control.compute=list(return.marginals.predictor=TRUE)')\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nIf the simple `inla()` call fails with a crash, you may need to install different\n`inla` binaries for your hardware/software combination,\nwith `INLA::inla.binary.install()`.\n\nWhen `inla()` works, you can check that `inlabru` is installed correctly by running\nthe same model in `inlabru`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit <- inlabru::bru(\n  y ~ Intercept(1, prec.linear = exp(-7)),\n  data = df\n)\nsummary(fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\ninlabru version: 2.13.0.9016 \nINLA version: 25.11.22 \nComponents: \nLatent components:\nIntercept: main = linear(1)\nObservation models: \n  Family: 'gaussian'\n    Tag: <No tag>\n    Data class: 'data.frame'\n    Response class: 'numeric'\n    Predictor: y ~ .\n    Additive/Linear: TRUE/TRUE\n    Used components: effects[Intercept], latent[] \nTime used:\n    Pre = 0.873, Running = 0.193, Post = 0.0128, Total = 1.08 \nFixed effects:\n           mean    sd 0.025quant 0.5quant 0.975quant  mode kld\nIntercept 9.974 0.103      9.771    9.974     10.177 9.974   0\n\nModel hyperparameters:\n                                         mean    sd 0.025quant 0.5quant\nPrecision for the Gaussian observations 0.952 0.134      0.708    0.946\n                                        0.975quant  mode\nPrecision for the Gaussian observations       1.23 0.933\n\nMarginal log-Likelihood:  -161.67 \n is computed \nPosterior summaries for the linear predictor and the fitted values are computed\n(Posterior marginals needs also 'control.compute=list(return.marginals.predictor=TRUE)')\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
