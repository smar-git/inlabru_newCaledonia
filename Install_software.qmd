Please use the instructions below to install and check your installation. 

If you run into issues, you can post a question with information about what you tried and what didn't work, on the [course github discussion page](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabruCourseMay2025/discussions) and Finn will reply when he's able.

Since 29 April 2025, the latest INLA package is built for R 4.5, so if you're able to upgrade your R installation, please do so to avoid unnecessary issues. The package will in many cases also work with older R versions, but compatibility is sometimes difficult.

## Installing `INLA` and `inlabru`

Due to the work involved in building the binaries for the INLA package C software for different architectures,
the INLA package is not on CRAN, but it can be installed from its own distribution
repository. The easiest approach is to add the repository to your local R options,
e.g. in `~/.Rprofile`,
so that `install.packages("INLA")` can work as usual. Alternatively, the same repository
information can be supplied via `install.packages("INLA", repos = ...)`.

In `~/.Rprofile`, add the following lines, or run the code in your R session:
```{r}
#| eval: false
local({
  r <- c(INLA = "https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/testing",
         CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org/",
         inlabru_universe = "https://inlabru-org.r-universe.dev")
  options(repos = r)
})
```
Note: if you have installed `INLA` from the `"stable"` repository instead of
`"testing"`, you may need to upgrade to the `"testing"` version,
which typically contains bug fixes and improvements, and is the version `inlabru` is tested against.

The third repository is optional, and gives you easy access to the development
versions of `inlabru` (`r packageVersion("inlabru")` or later) and `fmesher`
(`r packageVersion("fmesher")` or later, which is a package dependency of
`INLA` and `inlabru`).
Most of the tutorials in this course will work with the CRAN versions of `inlabru` and `fmesher`,
`2.12.0`, but installing the development version from `r-universe.dev` is recommended,
and required for a few new features and contains bug fixes, see
[the inlabru changelog](https://inlabru-org.github.io/inlabru/news/).

To install the packages, including optional dependencies many of which are
required for data analysis, run the following code in your R session:
```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("INLA", "inlabru"), dependencies = TRUE)
```
The warning about the unavailable `HKprocess` package can safely be ignored.
`INLA` also suggests two Bioconductor packages, `graph` and `Rgraphviz`, which are not
essential for this course, but can be installed with
```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install(c("graph", "Rgraphviz"), dep = TRUE)
```

## Installation check

Please check your installation using the basic model runs below. If you run into issues, you can post a question with information about what you tried and what didn't work, on the [course github discussion page](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabruCourseMay2025/discussions) and Finn will reply when he's able.

You can check that `INLA` is correctly installed by running
```{r}
#| eval: false
df <- data.frame(y = rnorm(100) + 10)
fit <- INLA::inla(
  y ~ 1,
  data = df
)
summary(fit)
```
If the simple `inla()` call fails with a crash, you may need to install different
`inla` binaries for your hardware/software combination,
with `INLA::inla.binary.install()`.

When `inla()` works, you can check that `inlabru` is installed correctly by running
the same model in `inlabru`:
```{r}
#| eval: false
fit <- inlabru::bru(
  y ~ Intercept(1, prec.linear = exp(-7)),
  data = df
)
summary(fit)
```
